=head1 NAME

PPIx::Regexp::Constant - Constants for the PPIx::Regexp system

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use PPIx::Regexp::Constant qw{ TOKEN_UNKNOWN }
 print "An unknown token's class is TOKEN_UNKNOWN\n";

=head1 INHERITANCE

C<PPIx::Regexp::Constant> is an L<Exporter|Exporter>.

C<PPIx::Regexp::Constant> has no descendants.

=head1 DETAILS

This module defines manifest constants for use by the various
C<PPIx::Regexp> modules. These constants are to be considered B<private>
to the C<PPIx::Regexp> system, and the author reserves the right to
change them without notice.

This module exports the following manifest constants:

=head2 @CARP_NOT

This global variable contains the names of all modules in the package.

=head2 ARRAY_REF

This is the result of C<ref []>.

=head2 CODE_REF

This is the result of C<ref sub {}>.

=head2 COOKIE_CLASS

The name of the cookie used to control the construction of character
classes.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure> when
the left square bracket is encountered, and cleared in the same module
when a right square bracket is encountered.

=head2 COOKIE_LOOKAROUND_ASSERTION

The name of the cookie used to control the parsing of zero-width
assertions.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Assertion|PPIx::Regexp::Token::GroupType::Assertion>,
and it persists until the end of the assertion.

=head2 COOKIE_QUANT

The name of the cookie used to control the construction of curly
bracketed quantifiers.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure> when a
left curly bracket is encountered. It requests itself to be cleared on
encountering anything other than a literal comma, a literal digit, or an
interpolation, or if more than one comma is encountered. If it survives
until L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Structure>
processes the right curly bracket, it is cleared there.

=head2 COOKIE_QUOTE

The name of the cookie used to control the parsing of C<\Q ... \E>
quoted literals.

This cookie is set in
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Control> when a
C<\Q> is encountered, and it persists until the next C<\E>.

=head2 COOKIE_REGEX_SET

The name of the cookie used to control regular expression sets.

=head2 FALSE

A false value. The author makes no commitment what the exact value is,
only that Boolean operations will see it as false.

=head2 HASH_REF

This is the result of C<ref {}>.

=head2 INFINITY

This is the IEEE 754 value of C<Inf> if that can be generated, or an
opaque overloaded object if not. Because the object does not (and I
think can not) implement the complete behavior of IEEE 754 C<Inf>, this
manifest constant should only be used for stringification and numeric
comparison. Be aware that the numification of the object has to be the
same as its stringification to keep C<looks_like_number()> happy.
B<Caveat coder>.

=head2 LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_ALLOWED

The Perl version at which allowed unescaped literal left curly brackets
were removed. This may make more sense if I mention that its value is
C<undef>.

=head2 LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_REMOVED_PHASE_1

The Perl version at which the first phase of unescaped literal left
curly bracket removal took place. The value of this constant is
C<'5.025001'>.

=head2 LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_REMOVED_PHASE_2

The Perl version at which the second phase of unescaped literal left
curly bracket removal took place. The value of this constant is
C<undef>, but it will be assigned a value when the timing of the second
phase is known.

=head2 LITERAL_LEFT_CURLY_REMOVED_PHASE_3

The Perl version at which the third phase of unescaped literal left
curly bracket removal took place. This is the removal of curly brackets
after a left parenthesis. The value of this constant is C<undef>, but it
will be assigned a value when the timing of the second phase is known.

=head2 MINIMUM_PERL

The minimum version of Perl understood by this parser, as a float. It is
currently set to 5.000, since that is the minimum version of Perl
accessible to the author.

=head2 MODIFIER_GROUP_MATCH_SEMANTICS

The name of the
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Modifier> group
used to control match semantics.

=head2 MSG_LOOK_BEHIND_TOO_LONG

An appropriate error message for an unknown entity created from a
quantifier which would make a look-behind assertion too long. This is
cribbed verbatim from the Perl error message.

=head2 MSG_PROHIBITED_BY_STRICT

An appropriate error message for an unknown entity created because
C<'strict'> was in effect. This is rank ad-hocery, and more than usually
subject to being changed, without any notice whatsoever. Caveat user.

=head2 NODE_UNKNOWN

The name of the class that represents an unknown node. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Node::Unknown|PPIx::Regexp::Node::Unknown>.

=head2 RE_CAPTURE_NAME

A string representation of a regular expression that matches the name of
a named capture buffer.

=head2 REGEXP_REF

This is the result of C<ref qr{}>.

=head2 SCALAR_REF

This is the result of C<ref \0>.

=head2 STRUCTURE_UNKNOWN

The name of the class that represents an unknown structure. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Unknown|PPIx::Regexp::Structure::Unknown>.

=head2 SUFFICIENT_UTF8_SUPPORT_FOR_WEIRD_DELIMITERS

A Boolean which is true if the running version of Perl has UTF-8 support
sufficient for our purposes.

Currently that means C<5.8.3> or greater, with the specific requirements
being C<use open qw{ :std :encoding(utf-8) }>, C</\p{Mark}/>, and the
ability to parse things like C<qr \N{U+FFFF}foo\N{U+FFFF}>.

=head2 TOKEN_LITERAL

The name of the class that represents a literal token. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Literal>.

=head2 TOKEN_UNKNOWN

The name of the class that represents the unknown token. That is,
L<PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown|PPIx::Regexp::Token::Unknown>.

=head2 TRUE

A true value. The author makes no commitment what the exact value is,
only that Boolean operations will see it as true.

=head2 VARIABLE_LENGTH_LOOK_BEHIND_INTRODUCED

The version in which variable-length look-behinds were introduced.
Currently this is C<'5.029009'>, and implies the limited lookbehind
introduced at or about that version.

=head1 SUPPORT

Support is by the author. Please file bug reports at
L<https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=PPIx-Regexp>,
L<https://github.com/trwyant/perl-PPIx-Regexp/issues>, or in
electronic mail to the author.
